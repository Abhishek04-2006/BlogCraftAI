# BlogCraftAI Learning Paths

BlogCraftAI is a structured training program that guides learners from non-technical onboarding to a production-ready AI-assisted blogging platform. This repository currently hosts the **Non-Technical Starter Track** on the main branch, along with blueprints for technical specialization tracks that will live on dedicated branches.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md`: High-level documentation, learning outcomes, and roadmap.
- `curriculum/non_technical_starter.md`: 30-hour facilitator-ready agenda for non-technical participants.
- `roadmap/branch_blueprints.md`: Scope documents for future technical branches (Django, Prompt Engineering, Frontend, BlogCraftAI, AI Agents).
- `resources/`: Curated references, checklists, and templates.
- `tests/README.md`: Explains the testing strategy for this documentation-focused stage.

## Non-Technical Starter Track Outcomes

Participants completing the 30-hour starter track will be able to:

1. Explain the BlogCraftAI product vision, core features, and stakeholder value.
2. Map content workflows from ideation to publication, including collaboration touchpoints.
3. Use provided templates to plan blog campaigns, capture requirements, and assess success metrics.
4. Identify the technical streams (Django, Prompt Engineering, Frontend, Full Stack, Automation) and understand how each contributes to the full platform.
5. Assemble a personalized learning and resource plan to transition into one of the technical specialization tracks.

## Required Resources (Main Branch)

- Video conferencing or classroom setup for facilitator-led sessions.
- Collaborative tools: digital whiteboard (e.g., Miro), shared documents (e.g., Google Docs/Notion).
- Printed or digital copies of the agenda, worksheets, and checklist templates located in `resources/`.
- Access to example blog posts, analytics snapshots, and personas to support hands-on activities.

## Technical Track Blueprints

Detailed curricula for the technical branches are prepared in `roadmap/branch_blueprints.md`. These blueprints outline:

- Learning objectives and prerequisites.
- Required tooling and environment setup.
- Milestone projects and assessment checkpoints.
- Testing and documentation expectations.

## Getting Started (Main Branch)

1. Review the 30-hour agenda in `curriculum/non_technical_starter.md`.
2. Gather the listed resources and configure the collaboration workspace before the first session.
3. Follow the facilitator checklist for each module to keep participants engaged and on schedule.
4. Capture learner feedback using the provided survey template to inform improvements before launching the technical tracks.

## Next Steps

- Once the main branch onboarding is complete, create the technical branches following the blueprints in `roadmap/branch_blueprints.md`.
- Each branch should introduce runnable code, comprehensive tests, and documentation adhering to the program-wide standards outlined here.
- Update this README with additional outcomes as branches graduate from planning to implementation.
