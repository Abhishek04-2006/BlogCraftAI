# Tests Directory

The current stage of the project focuses on curriculum and documentation assets for the non-technical starter track. No automated tests are required at this phase because no executable code has been introduced.

When technical branches are created, add the corresponding automated test suites here. Each subdirectory should include:
- `unit/` for fast-running isolated tests.
- `integration/` for service and database scenarios.
- `e2e/` for full workflow validation.
- A `README.md` describing coverage, tooling, and execution commands.

Maintaining this placeholder ensures the repository structure already accounts for testing expectations and aligns with the program-wide quality standards.
